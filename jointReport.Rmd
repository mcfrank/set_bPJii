#### Methods summary: 
Infants were presented with pictures of fearful and happy faces that were displayed subliminally (50ms; followed by a scrambled neutral face mask; then a neutral face for 900ms) or supraliminally (50ms; followed by a scrambled neutral face mask; then a face of the same emotion for 900ms). Eyetracking was used to measure pupil dilation across the whole trial and the duration of fixation on the second face.

#### Target outcomes: 

> 3.1. Pupil diameter

> We observed a main effect of Emotion [F(1, 19) = 6.45, MSE = .0039, p = .02, η2 = .25], revealing a larger pupil diameter for happy compared to fearful facial expressions irrespective of presentation condition (Figs. 2A and 3). There was no main effect of Presentation Condition [F(1, 19) = 0.40, MSE = .0029, p = .53, η2 = .02] and no interaction between Presentation Condition and Emotion [F(1, 19) = 1.17, MSE = .0011, p = .29, η2 = .06].

> A control analysis excluding items from one actress displaying no teeth in the fearful condition (see Methods) and three participants yielded a similar pattern of results, although the main effect of emotion is only marginally significant in this case [F(1, 16) = 3.845, p = 0.068, η2 = .19]. The marginal effect is likely explained by reduced power because we had to exclude three additional infants from this analysis (n = 17 instead of n = 20 in the main analysis) in order to adhere to our inclusion criterion.

## Step 1: Load packages


```{r}
library(tidyverse) # for data munging
library(knitr) # for kable table formating
library(readxl) # import excel files
library(CODreports) # custom report functions
library(purrr)
library(stringr)
library(magrittr)
```

## Step 2: Load data

Data are in two files. `data1.xlsx` appears to be the fixation data for each participant by condition and area of interest (AOI), while `data2.xlsx` appears to be the raw pupil size data for each participant and by trial timestamp. Many sheets per file, with variable names across multiple rows. 

Look at only `data2.xlsx`.

```{r}
data2sheets <- data_frame(participant = excel_sheets(path="data/data2.xlsx"))

d_all <- data2sheets %>%
  split(.$participant) %>%
  map_df(function(x) {
    d <- read_excel(path="data/data2.xlsx", 
               sheet=x$participant, 
               col_names = TRUE, 
               col_types = "text") 
    
    if (nrow(d) < 3) {
      return(NULL) 
    } else {
      d <- d %>%
        mutate(sid = as.numeric(str_replace(x$participant, "participant", "")),
               time = as.numeric(RecordingTimestamp),
               media = MediaName,
               pupil_left = as.numeric(PupilLeft), 
               pupil_right = as.numeric(PupilRight)) %>%
        select(sid, time, media, pupil_left, pupil_right) %>%
        filter(!is.na(time))
      return(d)
    }
  })
```


## Step 3: Tidy data

### Pre-processing

Because the raw data is given, all the preprocessing described in the article needs to be repeated. It said the analysis was done in MATLAB, but sadly no script was included with the data submission. 

### Preprocessing and Steps that were complete

Code for each of the processing steps and analyses I attempted to complete is below. 

First, for pupil diameter - one raw file of the Tobii recording was given for each participant. Need to remove trials based on their logic, and then take pupil averages per trial, then per condition and participant. 

> Pupil diameter was recorded for both eyes separately, and if data was available for both eyes, the mean was computed. If a value was only available for one eye, this value was considered for further analysis (on average 15% of the data points). For analyzing the pupil size, the entire duration of one trial (i.e. 2300 ms) was considered (Fig. 1). A trial was excluded from further analysis if a value was recorded for less than 50% of the sampling points during this time. Additionally, a trial was excluded if the infant did not look at the section of the screen where the sub- liminal stimulus (face 1) was presented in the subliminal condi- tions to ensure that infants were able to process the stimuli (on an unconscious level). 

First, find the chunks of data we are interested in. My hypothesis is that we want `happy`-`happy` and `fear`-`fear` conditions, as all of the others are not analyzed (the sclera conditions). 

```{r}
d <- d_all %>%
  filter(str_detect(media, "happy.*happy") | 
           str_detect(media, "fear.*fear")) %>%
  group_by(sid, media) %>%
  mutate(time = time - time[1], 
         pupil = mean(c(pupil_left, pupil_right), na.rm=TRUE)) 
```

Check the 15% figure. It's clear at this point that we're very far off. 

```{r}
mean(xor(is.na(d_all$pupil_left),is.na(d_all$pupil_right)))
mean(or(is.na(d_all$pupil_left),is.na(d_all$pupil_right)))
mean(xor(is.na(d$pupil_left),is.na(d$pupil_right)))
mean(or(is.na(d$pupil_left),is.na(d$pupil_right)))
```



```{r}
d %>%
  group_by(sid, media) %>%
  mutate
```


Assume each value in `MediaName` represents a new megablock, as described in the paper. Will put in a within-miniblock timestamp, then add trial number based on the blocks being 2300ms. This will be messed up in the calibration blocks, but these will be discarded for analysis. 



```{r}
pupildata = grep("participant", ls(), value=T)
for (i in pupildata){
  #first remove skips between lines & non-trial recordings
  if (nrow(get(i)) > 5) {
    temp = get(i)
    temp = subset(temp, is.na(temp$MediaName)==FALSE)
    #put in megablock timestamp (restart timestamp for each medianame)
    temp$BlockTimestamp = NA
    for (k in levels(factor(temp$MediaName))) {
      temp$BlockTimestamp[which(temp$MediaName==k)] = as.numeric(temp$RecordingTimestamp[which(temp$MediaName==k)]) - as.numeric(temp$RecordingTimestamp[which(temp$MediaName==k)][1])
    }
    #insert trial number for each block, assuming 2300ms per trial
    temp$TrialNumber = floor((temp$BlockTimestamp/2300))+1
    
    #insert indicator for number of eyes with pupil measure for each sampling point
    temp$NEyes = ifelse(is.na(temp$PupilLeft)==FALSE & is.na(temp$PupilRight)==FALSE, 2, 
                        ifelse(is.na(temp$PupilLeft) & is.na(temp$PupilRight), 0, 1))
    #keep only relevant conditions (not ones that say "eyes"; nor the calibration or sounds)
    conditionstokeep = grep("happy|fear", levels(factor(temp$MediaName)), value=T)[-grep("eyes", grep("happy|fear", levels(factor(temp$MediaName)), value=T))]
    temp = subset(temp, temp$MediaName %in% conditionstokeep)
    #add column for participant
    temp$participant = i
    #saved as "analyzed" version of data
    assign(paste(i, "analyzed", sep="_"), temp)}
  else {}
}

#bind datafiles together
allpart = do.call(rbind, mget(grep("analyzed", ls(), value=T)))


#remove trials with fewer than 5 data points (relics of the time-stamp based trial number assignment - typically these are one or two sampling points at the end of a trial)
trialcounts <- allpart %>%
                  group_by(MediaName, participant, TrialNumber) %>%
                  summarize(count=n())
badtrials = paste(trialcounts$participant[which(trialcounts$count < 5)], trialcounts$MediaName[which(trialcounts$count < 5)], trialcounts$TrialNumber[which(trialcounts$count < 5)], sep="_")

```

Add columns based on Media name
```{r}
#add column with emotion/condition (remove specifics of faces from MediaName)
allpart$trialtype = gsub("[[:digit:]]+|_down|_up|\\.avi", "", allpart$MediaName)

#add column with condition (supraliminal: emotion_emotion; or subliminal; emotion_neutral)
allpart$condition = factor(ifelse(allpart$trialtype=="fear_fear" | allpart$trialtype == "happy_happy", "supraliminal", ifelse(allpart$trialtype=="fear_neutral" | allpart$trialtype == "happy_neutral", "subliminal", NA)))
allpart$Emotion = factor(ifelse(allpart$trialtype=="fear_fear" | allpart$trialtype == "fear_neutral", "fear", ifelse(allpart$trialtype=="happy_happy" | allpart$trialtype == "happy_neutral", "happy", NA)))
allpart$Face1 <- factor(paste0("Face", gsub("[[:digit:]]{1}[[:alpha:]]+|_[[:alnum:]]+|\\.avi", "", allpart$MediaName)))


#create column with average pupil measure (ignoring NAs if only one eye is present)
allpart$PupilLeft = as.numeric(as.character(allpart$PupilLeft))
allpart$PupilRight = as.numeric(as.character(allpart$PupilRight))
allpart$PupilAvg = rowMeans(subset(allpart, select=c("PupilLeft", "PupilRight")), na=T)

#aggregate data to take pupil size means for each trial 
allpartag = allpart %>%
                group_by(MediaName, participant, TrialNumber, condition, Emotion) %>%
                summarize(PupilSize = mean(PupilAvg, na=T))


```


Now remove trials and participants based on logic described in article. 

> Pupil diameter was recorded for both eyes separately, and if data was available for both eyes, the mean was computed. If a value was only available for one eye, this value was considered for further analysis (on average 15% of the data points). 

```{r}
#create summary of how many trials had pupil data for 0, 1, or both eyes
eyecounts <- allpart %>%
                group_by(participant, MediaName, TrialNumber, NEyes) %>%
                summarize(count = n()) %>%
                spread(key=NEyes, value=count)
eyecounts$totalcount = rowSums(eyecounts[,c("0", "1", "2")], na.rm=T)
eyecounts$validcount = rowSums(eyecounts[,c("1", "2")], na.rm=T)

#how many data points only had one eye? 
mean(eyecounts$`1`/eyecounts$totalcount, na.rm=T) #out of all relevant trials
mean(eyecounts$`1`/eyecounts$validcount, na.rm=T) #out of all valid trials
```

The estimate of the percentage of one-eye trials among all relevant trials is a bit lower than reported. The percentage out of only valid trials, those with one or two eyes recorded, is higher.

```{r}
compareValues(reportedValue = 15, obtainedValue = 11.9)
```



>  A trial was excluded from further analysis if a value was recorded for less than 50% of the sampling points during this time. 

```{r}
#create indicator to remove trials if less than 50% of the data points had data for one or more eye (more than 50% had 0)
eyecounts$removetrial = ifelse(eyecounts$`0`/eyecounts$totalcount > .5, 1, 0)
trialstoremove = paste(eyecounts[which(eyecounts$removetrial==1),]$participant, eyecounts[which(eyecounts$removetrial==1),]$MediaName, eyecounts[which(eyecounts$removetrial==1),]$TrialNumber, sep="_")

#remove these trials
allpart.rm1 <- subset(allpart, paste(allpart$participant, allpart$MediaName, allpart$TrialNumber, sep="_") %in% trialstoremove==FALSE)

```

> Additionally, a trial was excluded if the infant did not look at the section of the screen where the sub- liminal stimulus (face 1) was presented in the subliminal condi- tions to ensure that infants were able to process the stimuli (on an unconscious level). 

This requires looking at the fixation data for subliminal trials to determine if 
the participant made any fixations on the face during the trial. Need to look at total time on AOI during subliminal trials. 

First, need to combine all the subliminal fixation data (allAOI sum duration variable) into a single data set:
```{r}
combined = as.data.frame(matrix(ncol=8))
names(combined) = c("Participant", "stimuli","AllAOI","NotonAOI","tottime","file","trial","emotion")
for (i in grep("_sub", ls(), value=T)) {
  temp <- get(i)
  #select only the sum of time spend on and not on AOI (all time on stimlus)
  temp <- subset(temp, select=c("__Participant", grep("AOI_Sum", names(temp), value=T)))
  names(temp) <- gsub("__", "", names(temp))
  #reshape to long
  templ <- gather(temp, stimuli, time, -Participant)
  #create variable for location
  templ$location <- factor(gsub("Face[[:digit:]]{2,3}_|_Sum", "", templ$stimuli))
  templ$stimuli <- factor(gsub("_NotonAOI_Sum|_AllAOI_Sum", "", templ$stimuli))
  #spread time based on location 
  tempw <- spread(templ, key = location, value=time)
  tempw$tottime <- rowSums(tempw[,c("AllAOI", "NotonAOI")])
  tempw$file <- i
  tempw$trial <- factor(gsub("face", "", gsub("cond[[:digit:]]+_|_sub", "", tempw$file)))
  tempw$emotion <- ifelse(gsub("_face[[:digit:]]+_sub", "", tempw$file) == "cond4", "happy", ifelse(gsub("_face[[:digit:]]+_sub", "", tempw$file) == "cond5", "fear", NA))
  combined <- rbind(combined, tempw) 
  }

summary(combined)

```

Need to combine with pupil data in order to eliminate trials where the infant did not look at the screen. 
```{r}
#remove "participant" from number in pupil data
allpart.rm1$participant <- gsub("participant", "", allpart.rm1$participant)

#only combine the subliminal trials
sublimpupil <- subset(allpart.rm1, allpart.rm1$condition == "subliminal")
#check overlap

summary(paste0(sublimpupil$participant, sublimpupil$Face1, sublimpupil$TrialNumber, sublimpupil$Emotion) %in% paste0(combined$Participant, combined$stimuli, combined$trial, combined$emotion))

sublimpupilcombined <- merge(sublimpupil, combined, by.x = c("participant", "Face1", "TrialNumber", "Emotion"), by.y=c("Participant", "stimuli", "trial", "emotion"))

```

Sum total fixations over trials and exclude any trials that have 0 total fixation time. 
```{r}
totsublimfixtime <- 
  sublimpupilcombined %>%
  group_by(TrialNumber, participant, Emotion) %>%
  summarize(totaltime=sum(tottime))

notlooking <- 
  totsublimfixtime %>%
  filter(totaltime==0) %>%
  mutate(parttrial = paste(participant, Emotion, TrialNumber, sep="_"))

allpart.rm2 <- subset(allpart.rm1, paste(allpart.rm1$participant, allpart.rm1$Emotion, allpart.rm1$TrialNumber, allpart.rm1$condition, sep="_") %in% paste(notlooking$parttrial, "subliminal", sep="_")==FALSE)


```


Now aggregate data to determine how many trials each participant contributed per condition. It is unclear whether "condition" strictly means subliminal/supraliminal, or also includes emotion. 
```{r}

#aggregate data to take pupil size means for each trial 
allpart.rmag = allpart.rm2 %>%
                group_by(participant, TrialNumber, condition, Emotion) %>%
                summarize(PupilSize = mean(PupilAvg, na.rm=T))

#count number of trials per condition for each infant
numtrials = allpart.rmag %>%
              group_by(participant, condition) %>%
              summarize(ntrials = n()) %>%
              ungroup() %>%
              complete(participant,condition, fill=list(ntrials=0))


#remove infants who do not have at least one trial in each condition. 
kable(filter(numtrials, ntrials==0))
parttorm <- unique(filter(numtrials, ntrials==0)$participant)


```

> Only infants with at least one trial per con- dition following these criteria were included in the final analysis.

There were `r length(parttorm)` participants who needed to be removed. 
```{r}
allpart.rmag = subset(allpart.rmag, allpart.rmag$participant %in% parttorm==FALSE)

#count number of trials per condition for each infant
summarytrials <-
  allpart.rmag %>%
  group_by(participant, condition) %>%
  summarize(ntrials = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  summarize(Mean = mean(ntrials), SD = sd(ntrials))

```


> For statistical analysis, the mean pupil diameter over the entire trial duration was computed. These values were averaged sepa- rately for every participant and condition and divided by the over- all mean pupil size of that participant to account for possible interindividual differences.

```{r}
pupildata = allpart.rmag %>%
            group_by(participant, condition, Emotion) %>%
            summarize(AvgPupilSize = mean(PupilSize, na.rm=T))

#divide by participant's mean pupil size
pupildata$relPupilSize = NA
for (i in 1:nrow(pupildata)) {
  pupildata$relPupilSize[i] = pupildata$AvgPupilSize[i]/mean(pupildata$AvgPupilSize[which(pupildata$participant == pupildata$participant[i])])
} 


```

## Step 4: Run analysis


### Descriptive statistics

Average number of trials infants (n = `r length(levels(factor(numtrials$participant)))`) contributed to the pupil data

> In the final sample, infants contributed on average 9.7 trials per condition (SD = 3.9).

```{r}

kable(summarytrials, digits = 1, caption = "Number of trials per infant")
```

The numbers here are quite different than what was reported. I'm guessing something went wrong in the preprocessing. The mean number of trials was slightly lower than reported in the paper, and the SD was also slightly lower. 

```{r}
compareValues(reportedValue = 9.7, obtainedValue = 7.32)
compareValues(reportedValue = 3.9, obtainedValue = 3.39)
```

### Inferential statistics
> 3.1. Pupil diameter

> We observed a main effect of Emotion [F(1, 19) = 6.45, MSE = .0039, p = .02, η2 = .25], revealing a larger pupil diameter for happy compared to fearful facial expressions irrespective of presentation condition (Figs. 2A and 3). There was no main effect of Presentation Condition [F(1, 19) = 0.40, MSE = .0029, p = .53, η2 = .02] and no interaction between Presentation Condition and Emotion [F(1, 19) = 1.17, MSE = .0011, p = .29, η2 = .06].

```{r}
summary(aov(relPupilSize ~ condition*Emotion + Error(participant/(condition*Emotion)), data=pupildata))

```

The degrees of freedom are off in this analysis, suggesting that the number of participants I excluded did not match the number they excluded in their analysis. There was a trend of a main effect of emotion in this analysis. 
However, given the number of data points in this analysis doesn't match what they are reporting, the most likely error here is insufficient information. 

At this point, we need more information from the authors to continue this replication analysis. 

> A control analysis excluding items from one actress displaying no teeth in the fearful condition (see Methods) and three participants yielded a similar pattern of results, although the main effect of emotion is only marginally significant in this case [F(1, 16) = 3.845, p = 0.068, η2 = .19]. The marginal effect is likely explained by reduced power because we had to exclude three additional infants from this analysis (n = 17 instead of n = 20 in the main analysis) in order to adhere to our inclusion criterion.

```{r}
```

## Step 5: Conclusion


I initially tried to replicate the preprocessing based on the description in the article (which is presented below), but because the MATLAB article was not provided, there were a lot of assumptions that had to be made. Here are some specific questions/information that would be needed: 

1. The data provided is assumed to be the raw data collected by Tobii for eyetracking and pupil measurement, but is not the the correct format needed for analysis. The article mentions a MATLAB script that was used for preprocessing this data. Could the authors provide this script? 
2. There is no trial number or other variables about each trial in the pupil data files - the preprocessing done below is based on the time stamps and timing described in the article, but it is not specific enough to determine whether my division of trials are exactly the same as the authors'. 
3. Each dataset does not contain the necessary variables for the analyses as described in the article. Condition, emotion, and trial had to be inserted based on the legend and by trying to interpret the numeric codes used in the media name (pupil data) and the tab/face codes in the fixation data. 
4. Exclusion criteria were explained in the article, but it was unclear what variables in which dataset were used to make the decisions. The number of excluded participants (and remaining trials per participant) I got in my preprocessing steps did not match the numbers reported.
5. Finally, because of the lack of information in the preprocessing and exclusion instructions, the degrees of freedom in the first analysis did not match the DoF reported in the results (F(1,19) reported versus F(1,21) found here). Instead of a numeric error, it's likely these errors all stem from a lack of information about the processing steps, given that only the raw data was provided. 


I am putting the conclusions here, as the insufficient error prevents me from completing the replication. I will include the numeric errors that I found in the analyses I could complete, but I believe they may be a result of insufficient information. 

```{r}
codReport(Report_Type = 'pilot',
          Article_ID = 'bPJii', 
          Insufficient_Information_Errors = 1,
          Decision_Errors = 0, 
          Major_Numerical_Errors = 3, 
          Minor_Numerical_Errors = 0)
